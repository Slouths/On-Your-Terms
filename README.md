## üí™ Challenges Overcome, Solutions Delivered

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Making web scraper to find ToS | We troubleshooted the URL endpoints to make sure the correct connections were being made. |
| Getting hosting to work | We removed specific versions from certain libraries and backtraced to find the correct versions that would allow us to successfully host. |
| Connecting the extension and webpage to the backend | We all contributed to writing the code to connect the extension to the backend through the use of GitHub and communicating non-stop to ensure that the code was working. |

## üß† Lessons Learned for Future Iterations

- Consistent GitHub commits are crucial: We should have started committing through GitHub consistently from the beginning. This oversight created numerous issues when merging our contributions later, especially as we approached the project deadline.

- Documentation is key: More thorough documentation throughout the development process would have been beneficial. This aligns with the first issue, as we found ourselves backtracing significantly to reconstruct our documentation history.

- Early skill assessment and Git proficiency: Identifying team members' strengths earlier and improving our collective knowledge of Git could have saved considerable time during the final collaboration stages of the project.

## ‚ú® Envisioning the Future: Planned Features

- [ ] Remote hosted servers via AWS or Google Cloud Services to run 24/7
- [ ] Ability for user to enter their own API key so as to not overload individual API key used for project. 
- [ ] Pagination: Extension will have different pages to store past ToS(s) that have been agreed to by the user for reviewal.


## üõ†Ô∏è Local Development Setup
- To run locally, create a .env file within the On-Your-Terms project file. Within this file create a variable called GOOGLE_API_KEY and set that equal to your own custom Gemini API key that can be found at https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey.
- NOTE: .env FILE WITH PERSONAL API KEY WILL BE STORED WITHIN REPO FOR THE DURATION OF HACKATHON. THEREFORE THE STEPS ABOVE MAY BE IGNORED DURING HACKATHON.
